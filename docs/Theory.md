# Theoretical Framework

## Objective

The objective of this document is to provide a **mathematical and theoretical perspective** on the analysis of marketing performance.

Rather than focusing on implementation details or specific tools, this section aims to formalize the core concepts that underpin modern marketing analytics, including:

- Measurement of campaign effectiveness  
- Incremental impact and causal effects  
- Experimental and quasi-experimental designs  
- Statistical and econometric foundations  
- Connections between classical inference and machine learning approaches  

The goal is to build a rigorous conceptual foundation that supports the empirical analyses presented in the accompanying notebooks.
