## 1. Introduction and Scope

The objective of this document is to provide a **mathematical and theoretical perspective** on the analysis of marketing performance.

Rather than focusing on the implementation details or specific tools, this section aims to formalize the core concepts that underpin modern marketing analytics, including:

- Measurement of campaign effectiveness  
- Incremental impact and causal effects  
- Experimental and quasi-experimental designs  
- Statistical foundations  
- Connections between classical inference and machine learning approaches  

The main goal is to build a rigorous conceptual foundation that supports the empirical analyses presented in the accompanying notebooks.
